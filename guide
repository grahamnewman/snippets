## Archanawat style guide | writing
Initial commit 11 October

Our style guide serves as a comprehensive blueprint, ensuring consistency and coherence in written and visual communication. In writing, it establishes guidelines for grammar, tone, and formatting, fostering clarity and professionalism. In branding, it defines logo usage, color schemes, and typography, ensuring a unified and recognizable identity across all platforms. By providing clear directives, a style guide enhances brand integrity and fosters a cohesive, compelling narrative.

***

- Concrete and simple.
- Short sentences.
- Use short common words of the English language that everybody knows.
- People should be at the heart of the sentence.
- Avoid metaphors and cliches.
- Active sentences.
- Hit the full stop button as often as you can.

What are your audience's needs? Earn their time and attention that you can see in your mind's eye.
Less of a chore, more pleasurable.

Avoid abstractions, cliches and twisted vocabulary.

Be honest with the audience:
- Clarity.
- Brevity.
- Simplicity.
- Creativity.

Avoid the language of academics. Use ordinary speech.

- Write the storyline.
- Edit the storyline.
- Publish the storyline.

Full stops and short sentences. Avoid semicolons at all costs.

Avoid _hopefully_, _prestigious_, _iconic_, _get_, _key_, _major_. They are overused.

Don't be formulaic with writing style. Be original and clear.

Don't use phrasings of the industry insiders and the overall in-group jargon.

Simplify things all the time.

Try to avoid starting a sentence with _yet_ or _but_.

Originality is the premium. Come up with headlines and captions that are original.

Write to make your reader smile.

Make the style distinct.

We do not use the Oxford comma unless it clears up some ambiguity. The less punctuation the better. For example:
**Without Oxford comma**: “Her favourite foods were chocolate, marshmallows, cake and chicken.”
**With Oxford comma**: “Her favourite foods were chocolate, marshmallows, cake, and chicken.”

Break any of these rules rather than do anything ugly or unclear.

Write, do not use GPT.
Keep it simple.

An exclamation in an email should only be used if there’s a birth, a promotion or an engagement. Not to say that you have a meeting on Thursday.

### Product guidance
_Antivirus_ and _antibacteria_ are **not** hyphenated.

### Writing style guidance

1. British English, not American English with the exception of _center_, not _centre_. And use _color_, instead of _colour_. There’s no need to be too puritanical about this.
1. Wrirte in _Sentance case_. Do not use _Initial Capitalisations_ unless it's an entity name eg, _Stock Exchange of Thailand_.
1. Always write _and_, not _&_ (ampersand) unless used in a company name eg, _Procter & Gamble_ or _Johnson & Johnson_. 
1. We follow The Economist Style Guide for punctuation and grammar. 
1. All copy adheres to the 4C’s rule. Our writing is:
- Clear. 
- Concise. 
- Credible. 
- Compelling.

All copy must include FAB: 
- Feature. 
- Advantage. 
- Benefit.

Connect to users lifestyles and values formed by trends and changes in **political**, **environmental**, **social**, **technological** and **economic** factors. To invoke a handy acronym: PESTE.

**Contactions**
Always use contractions where posssibe. It's friendlier. Use _don't_ instead of _do not_, _haven't_ instead of _have not_, _aren't_ instead of _are not_ etc.

---
**Numbers**
Write the number in full from one to nine. Thereafter use numerals: 10, 11, 12 etc.

---

**Punctuation**
Colons: always use lower case after the colon as in this sentence. Unless its a name: Archanawat.
